This small change improves the clarity of the documentation, helping users better understand the potential issue they might encounter when cloning the repository and why they need to use the specified Git flag.",

    "body": "This adds a short and simple header-based auth backend (and tests!). This allows greater flexibility in auth mechanisms out of the box.\r\n\r\nFor example, I'm working on on an internal library to interface with OGC services and three providers use three different auth mechanisms. Being able to consolidate this via the auth parameter seems like the correct solution.\r\n\r\nIt's worth noting that because of when this executes, auth objects override the headers provided both by the session and request call. This has been appropriately documented, and I don't believe any other option would be preferable.\r\n\r\nLooks like someone proposed this in 2018 (#4823) but was rejected because of a feature freeze at the time.\r\n\r\nIf this is acceptable, would the team be interested in something similar like HTTPParamAuth that uses a dict of parameters in a similar fashion? Going back to my library example, one provider uses oauth, which requests supports, one uses headers, and one uses a custom api key parameter. Totally willing to add it to this PR if it simplifies approval :)",

Due to the number of edge cases and concurrency issues we've encountered with this change, we've decided the benefit doesn't currently outweigh the pain to existing infrastructure. We've iterated on a few tries to keep this functionality in place, but are still receiving reports of novel issues with this behavior.\r\n\r\nWe may be able to revisit this in a later version of Requests but we'll need a much more comprehensive test plan.",

    "body": "## Overview\r\nThis PR is intended to address two distinct issues introduced with the default cert optimizations originally introduced in 2.32.0. While we continue to refine the settings considered when opting into our optimized context, we'll no longer use the new default if any custom cert values are supplied. This addresses the concurrency issues raised in #6726.\r\n\r\nThe second piece of this will be ensuring that when opting out of the default SSLContext, we're still supplying to the default CA Cert bundle correctly. This addresses the problems noticed in https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/6710#issuecomment-2137802782 and #6730.\r\n\r\n## Considerations\r\n\r\nWe're now duplicating a decent chunk of the [logic from cert_verify](https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/0e322af87745eff34caffe4df68456ebc20d9068/src/requests/adapters.py#L324-L357) inside [_urllib3_request_context](https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/0e322af87745eff34caffe4df68456ebc20d9068/src/requests/adapters.py#L115-L128) but without our validation exceptions. That's a potential vector for behavioral shifts in the future. We _could_ consolidate some of this behavior in one place but it's going to require constructing a dict and using `setattr` on our `conn` in `cert_verify` while setting `pool_kwargs` in `_urllib3_request_context`. I started writing that up but it feels clunky. This is probably going to be a tradeoff of risking drift like we have with Session settings and binding the two behaviors together too tightly.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nI'd like to codify the issues we've encountered through the whole 2.32.x saga in tests to hopefully avoid this in the future. Doing it cleanly without relying on external endpoints is proving to be a bit more involved than I'd like. I think we can harness some of the infrastructure added in #6662, but I haven't had a chance to really dig into that.",

Once those blockers are moved, we can merge this into our CI to prepare for the upcoming release candidates.\r\n\r\nCurrently it looks like `flsgger` and `greenlet` are having issues from httpbin. I think we have an open proposal/request to make `flsgger` optional which seems fine. `greenlet` currently has a proposed patch from Victor Stinner so I would assume that's resolved sooner than later.",

The underlying behavior will apparently be changed in 3.x, but in the meantime it would be helpful to call out the behavior in the docs to avoid catching people out (the issue has been locked due to a large number of comments).\r\n\r\nI'm happy to rework this PR as needed, but it'd be great to get something in the docs about this in one form or another to help prevent people hitting this.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your thoughts!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Change Details\r\n\r\n* Added a `warning::` callout to the relevant section of the docs.\r\n\r\n## Alternate Approaches Considered\r\n\r\nI initially wrote out a longer section detailing the semantics for how the various options interact \u2014 but all the other interactions are very intuitive, so this felt like overkill. Let me know if you'd prefer that approach.\r\n\r\nThis section of the docs is also a bit callout heavy, so I'm happy to inline the text rather than put it in a callout, if you prefer.",

    "body": "The `Response.iter_lines` method is seriously broken (it inserts fake blank lines in unpredictable places.)\n\nThe earliest report of this I've found is pull #2431 (January 2015).\n\nThe behavior was apparently fixed in the 3.0.0 branch, by pulls #3923 and #3984.  (I think #3923 fixes the `delimiter!=None` case and #3984 fixes the `delimiter=None` case.  But I haven't tested it.)\n\nThe problem was raised again in issues #3980, #4121, and #5540.\n\nPull #4629 attempted to partially fix the issue in the master branch, and was rejected.\n\nPersonally, I am skeptical that there is any benefit in preserving this broken behavior.  But folks who know better than I do have said that it needs to be maintained.\n\nAs long as this *isn't* fixed, people using the library should be informed that method is broken and they shouldn't use it.\n",

    "body": "See bug #6294 for original bug report.\r\n\r\nThis PR provides a possible fix for this, reverting the change in #2896.\r\n\r\nThe change in #2896 definitely causes some bad side effects, since not all web servers handle \"chunked\" transfer encoding (i.e. some don't handle it, some don't handle it well).\r\n\r\n### Problem demonstration\r\n\r\nGiven a simple bottle application:\r\n```python\r\nfrom bottle import run, put, request, default_app\r\n\r\napp = default_app()\r\n\r\n@app.put(\"/\")\r\ndef receive_file():\r\n    upload = request.body.read()\r\n    for head, val in request.headers.items():\r\n        print(\"%-30s:\\t%s\" % (head, val))\r\n    clength = request.headers.get(\"Content-Length\", \"not-set\")\r\n    cencoding = request.headers.get(\"Transfer-Encoding\", \"not-set\")\r\n    return { 'size': len(upload), 'content-length': clength, 'transfer-encoding': cencoding }\r\n\r\nif __name__ == '__main__':\r\n    app.run(host='localhost', port=8880)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd a simple requests script:\r\n```python\r\nimport requests\r\nimport io\r\nempty_obj = io.BytesIO(b'')\r\nresp = requests.put('http://localhost:8880/', data=empty_obj)\r\nprint(resp.status_code)\r\nif resp.status_code == 200:\r\n    print(resp.json())\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Working Scenario\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ python server.py\r\nBottle v0.12.25 server starting up (using WSGIRefServer())...\r\nListening on http://localhost:8880/\r\nHit Ctrl-C to quit.\r\n\r\nContent-Length                :\t\r\nContent-Type                  :\ttext/plain\r\nHost                          :\tlocalhost:8880\r\nUser-Agent                    :\tpython-requests/2.31.0\r\nAccept-Encoding               :\tgzip, deflate, br\r\nAccept                        :\t*/*\r\nConnection                    :\tkeep-alive\r\nTransfer-Encoding             :\tchunked\r\n127.0.0.1 - - [03/Nov/2023 15:51:51] \"PUT / HTTP/1.1\" 200 65\r\n```\r\nTest script output:\r\n```\r\n200\r\n{'size': 0, 'content-length': '', 'transfer-encoding': 'chunked'}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Failing Scenario\r\n```\r\n$ gunicorn -b localhost:8880 server:app\r\n[2023-11-03 15:52:05 +0100] [1326049] [INFO] Starting gunicorn 21.2.0\r\n[2023-11-03 15:52:05 +0100] [1326049] [INFO] Listening at: http://127.0.0.1:8880 (1326049)\r\n[2023-11-03 15:52:05 +0100] [1326049] [INFO] Using worker: sync\r\n[2023-11-03 15:52:05 +0100] [1326050] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 1326050\r\n```\r\nTest script output:\r\n```\r\n400\r\n```\r\n\r\n### The Original Issue\r\n\r\nThe change causing this problem in the first place was due to failing to upload data read from a subprocess pipe.\r\n\r\nThis patch adds a check to `super_len` that avoids returning length 0 for file handles that are not regular files.",

    "body": "### Summary\r\nThis PR adds kwargs arguments to `HTTPAdapter.send`, which it passes to `HTTPConnectionPool.urlopen` in urllib3.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nAs discussed in #4956, urrllib3 recently changed the default value of `enforce_content_length` from `False` to `True`. The new default seems like a sane choice, but in some use cases the `Content-Length` header should not be enforced. To change the default behavior, urllib3 allows application code to set the `enforce_content_length` argument. As far as I know, `requests` does not have a way to pass this argument to urllib3.\r\n\r\nThe `HTTPConnectionPool.urlopen` method in urllib3 has the `**response_kw` kwargs argument to pass extra arguments down to the response parser. This PR adds a similar to argument to `HTTPAdapter.send`.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, users can override the `HTTPAdapter.send` method to pass extra arguments to `HTTPConnectionPool.urlopen`. For example, this enables users to explicitly set the `enforce_content_length`.\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n```Python\r\nimport requests\r\n\r\nfrom requests.adapters import HTTPAdapter\r\n\r\nclass EnforceContentLengthAdapter(HTTPAdapter):\r\n    def send(self, *args, **kwargs):\r\n        kwargs[\"enforce_content_length\"] = False\r\n        return super().send(*args, **kwargs)\r\n\r\ns = requests.Session()\r\ns.mount(\"http://\", EnforceContentLengthAdapter())\r\ns.mount(\"https://\", EnforceContentLengthAdapter())\r\n\r\nr = s.get(\"http://localhost:8080/\")\r\nprint(r.raw.enforce_content_length) # Returns False\r\n```",

    "body": "This makes some documentation changes that clarify the `files` argument of `requests.post()` et. al.\r\n\r\n## Be more precise when we say \"multiple files\"\r\n\r\nThe `files` argument can either be a dict:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfiles = {\r\n    \"field_1\": file_1,\r\n    \"field_2\": file_2,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr a list of tuples:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfiles = [\r\n    (\"field_1\": file_1),\r\n    (\"field_2\": file_2),\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nA few places implied that to \"upload multiple files in one request,\" you had to use the list-of-tuples syntax. But the dict syntax supports multiple files just fine. The added power in the list-of-tuples syntax seems to be that you can upload multiple files *to the same form field.* So, we now say that.\r\n\r\n## Update the reference docs\r\n\r\nThe API reference documentation did not completely describe what values were acceptable for `files`, and in some cases it was misleading.\r\n\r\n* It didn't mention the list-of-tuples syntax at all.\r\n* It said you could pass a \"dictionary of `'name': file-like-objects`\". The pluralization there makes it look like you can do something like `{\"name\": [file_1, file_2]}`, but that's not correct.\r\n* It didn't describe what you were allowed to provide as a \"`fileobj`\". (It can be a file-like object, or `str` contents, or `bytes` contents.)\r\n* It said `name` to refer to the value that Requests uses as the form field name. This could be misconstrued as the file name. [RFC 7578](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7578) and other examples within Requests call it the \"field name\" or \"form field name.\"\r\n\r\nMy sources for these changes:\r\n\r\n* The existing [POST a Multipart-Encoded File](https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/7f694b79e114c06fac5ec06019cada5a61e5570f/docs/user/quickstart.rst?plain=1#L300) section.\r\n* The existing [POST Multiple Multipart-Encoded Files](https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/7f694b79e114c06fac5ec06019cada5a61e5570f/docs/user/advanced.rst?plain=1#L391) section.\r\n* [Request's type stubs](https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/8080e491d2fa92b1b1390c87fac23a1a38dcd919/stubs/requests/requests/sessions.pyi#L91).\r\n\r\nIt's difficult to describe this API concisely because it accepts so many different input shapes, and these additions do make the rendered docs feel a bit crowded.",

I am open to any changes we might want to make to improve this documentation and help users better understand the exceptions their code may be throwing.",

    "body": "Python added f-strings in version 3.6, with [PEP 498](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/). F-strings are a flexible and powerful way to format strings. They make the code shorter and more readable, since the code now looks more like the output.\r\n\r\nF-Strings are also more performant than using `.format` (e.g. see [F-String Speed Considerations](https://realpython.com/lessons/f-strings-speed-considerations-performance/), [F-String Benchmarks](https://www.scivision.dev/python-f-string-speed/) for two quick examples) because the python runtime can insert the variables into the string while parsing rather than backtracking to insert them into the placeholders, reducing the number of times the lines need to be processed",

    "body": "Adds support for the `|` and `|=` operators for `CaseInsensitiveDict`.\r\n\r\nThis copies the functionality of `dict` from [PEP 584](https://peps.python.org/pep-0584). Even though this PEP was implemented in 3.9, the functionality implemented to `CaseInsensitiveDict` still works in all currently supported versions (3.7+).\r\n\r\nThis also brings a level of consistency with other Mapping types, i.e. `OrderedDict`, `MappingProxyType`, `ChainMap`, `WeakKeyDictionary`, and more have this as supported behavior.\r\n\r\nThe code itself is a slightly modified version of the [reference implementation](https://peps.python.org/pep-0584/#reference-implementation).\r\n\r\nExample usage:\r\n```python3\r\nsession = Session()\r\nsession.headers |= {'Accept', 'application/json'}\r\n```",

This is a hurdle to accepting #5664, a change which would both simplify requests' code and consistently use [urllib3 for retrying errors](https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/urllib3.util.html).  \r\n\r\nThe [existing test server](https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/main/tests/testserver/server.py) is a simple socket that can send and receive data and is not aware of HTTP protocols.  Therefore, using it to verify correct sending of chunked-encoded data, for instance, would ultimately become a change-detector test.  \r\n\r\nThis change seeks to remedy that while also taking a step towards both simplifying and strengthening requests' tests.\r\n\r\nWe strengthen requests' tests by introducing the popular [Werkzeug library](https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug) as an explicit test dependency ([Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask), which uses Werkzeug, is already a test dependency).  By doing so, we leverage their authority as an implementer of [PEP 3333](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3333/) to validate our own implementation of chunked encoding.  This implicitly future-proofs against any hypothetical breaking changes to the standard by testing against Werkzeug's trusted implementation.\r\n\r\nWe also simplify requests' tests, since the implementation of the test [WerkzeugServer](https://github.com/psf/requests/commit/f1f838e36bc24fb40d7121e72298da3e5a7149ff#diff-a53b39ec2e425dad0c8387f8402839b2ec328e93494086ed66abb4b49708deeb) here is substantially more concise than the [current test server](https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/main/tests/testserver/server.py).  If this change is accepted, in another pull request I will refactor all of requests' tests to use the WerkzeugServer rather than the current test server.  ",

The json decoder from the Python standard libs also accepts such scalar values.\r\n\r\nThe JSON Unicode detection algorithm in \"requests\" assumes that the first two characters are always ASCII. That is not true anymore.\r\nTherefore the current detection fails in at least these two edge cases\r\n\r\n- A single digit in UTF-16 encoding\r\n- A quoted string with the first character having a Unicode value higher than 255 in UTF-16 encoding\r\n\r\nAlso autodetection by chardet returns the wrong encoding.\r\n\r\nThis change detects the encoding in case of those two edge cases.\r\n",

    "body": "A re-write of https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/4935\r\nAddresses: https://github.com/psf/requests/issues/4938\r\nand perhaps others.\r\n\r\nIn short, there are three types of values: the instance values (e.g. those passed in via the `get(...)`, `request(...)`, etc.), the session values (e.g. those set for the session such as `s.verify = \"/some/cert\"`), and system or environment level values (e.g. the environment variable for the CA_BUNDLE that, at times, becomes the value for the verify flag).\r\n\r\nWorking with @sorech02, we determined that the best course of action was to just move the session level merging before the environment merging. I.e., the current flow is as follows: one of the simple request calls is made, e.g. `request`, `get`, `delete`, etc., then, the `merge_environment_settings` method is called wherein environment values are merged in (e.g. the CA_BUNDLE value) and then the session level settings are merged in via the `merge_settings` calls in `merge_environment_settings`.\r\n\r\nThis is too late because, by default, trust_env is set to True, which will result in the `verify` value passed into the session merging to not be none. One solution is to make sure you set trust_env to False before using the verify flag with a custom certificate, but we deemed this to only be a work around.\r\n\r\nThe true fix, as described above, is to ensure that the settings which are constructed give the proper precedence to the values given. I.e. passed > session > environment.\r\nWe were forced to leave the `setdefaults` (which effectively reapply the session values if there are no values set) in the `def send` alone because, at times, one might use `send` itself when constructing prepared requests (i.e. not via `request`, `get`, etc.). In which  case, the function must still ensure to use the session level settings.",

(see #4795)\r\n\r\nNote that this delegates to urllib more often, as stated [here](https://github.com/requests/requests/issues/4795#issuecomment-425886286). I don't have the history behind `should_bypass_proxies` implementation, therefore my change is the tiniest possible (minimum thing to fix the greedy behavior). I don't know exactly why requests tries some things first and then delegates to urllib though.\r\n\r\nFixes #4795 ",
